My project is a "interactive" like illustration with a moving character. It is a small character and a building that it owns. You can move the character left and right across the screen but only limited to one scene. 

Orignally I was trying my best to not make a 'game' as thats not what i was trying to execute. I wanted a illustration piece where a character can walk around in, making it interactive in that sense. I wanted to test my skills with using pieces of what i learn and what i can draw for this project. I drew a character with two side profiles, a left and a right, with a face forward profile as well. I inputed a gradient from a light pink to a blue, generating small white sparkles that randomly appear across the screen as the engine runs. I inputed a image of a building and platform where the character is restricted to the platform itself so its not running all over the screen and floating.  

Overall, I am happy with the outcome and what I was able to execute and how far I have come from with almost no knowledge of coding since this semester started.
