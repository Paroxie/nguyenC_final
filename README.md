My project is a "interactive" like illustration with a moving character. It is a small character and a building that it owns. You can move the character left and right across the screen but only limited to one scene. 

Orignally I was trying my best to not make a 'game' as thats not what i was trying to execute. I wanted a illustration piece where a character can walk around in, making it interactive in that sense. I wanted to test my skills with using pieces of what i learn and what i can draw for this project. I drew a character with two side profiles, a left and a right, with a face forward profile as well. I inputed a gradient from a light pink to a blue, generating small white sparkles that randomly appear across the screen as the engine runs. I inputed a image of a building and platform where the character is restricted to the platform itself so its not running all over the screen and floating.  

I had wish to add more scenes where it almost becomes endless to where ever the character walks and include some walk animations to the character.

Some improvements id love to add is to add more details and maybe generate some clouds in the background. There are some ideas that I have now that would be better since now I have more of a understanding and that I think would be a better improvment or note id add if i had to add to this project. Also maybe to fully make a game like project where the illustration changes with what the character picks up.

Overall, I am happy with the outcome and what I was able to execute and how far I have come from with almost no knowledge of coding since this semester started.
